When would you create a remote repository rathen just keeping it local in your computer?
Because I might want to work on the project from different computer and the remote repository will help to keep both computers in sync.  Also, to have a backup of your project in case your computer crashes.  Another reason would be when several people are working on the project.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because other people may be contributing to the project and you are at a stage in your computer where you are not ready to pull in additional files or changes to existing ones.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork. Copies a repository in Github into another github account
Clone. Copies a repository from a Github account into a local repository. You can also copy a local repository into another local repository.
Branch.  Add another node to the tree of commits.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So that you can incorporate those changes in your current work.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
After seeing the benefits of git and github, it would be hard to think about collaboration without using any of the two.  One way to do it is have different people work on non-overlapping parts of the projects. For example, different functions or different classes.
