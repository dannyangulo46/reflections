What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A hidden .git file gets created in the directory.  You do it so that you can begin tracking the changes made to the files in that directory.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area shows the file that are about to get committed.  In order to add a file to the staging are the command git add "File name" is used.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Not so sure.
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Different branches provide the ability to try two or more different working scenarios. For example, if you are coding a game and you want to have an offshoot of the original game you can do so with a branch.
